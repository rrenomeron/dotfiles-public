If emacs loaded dotfiles-public/emacs/emacs_config.el, these themes should
be automatically available, at least in Emacs 24 and up.
Load the themes with the following bit of lisp:

(load-theme '$NAME t)

in your .emacs or in scratch buffer.  Or use 'Custom Themes' under
the Options->Customize Emacs menu option.
